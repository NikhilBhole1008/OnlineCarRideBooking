# FREE NOW backend applicant preparation

## Live Coding Challenge

This document will give you all the information you need in preparation for the interview.

This  project contains an example project which we will be working on in the Live Coding Interview. Please familiarize yourself with the project. 

## Project Description

You should be able to start the example application by executing com.freenow.FreeNowServerApplicantTestApplication, which starts a webserver on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080).

The project is based on a small web service which uses the following technologies:

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* Database H2 (In-Memory)
* Maven

* The architecture of the web service is built with the following components:
    * DataTransferObjects: Objects which are used for outside communication via the API
    * Controller: Implements the processing logic of the web service, parsing of parameters and validation of in- and outputs.
    * Service: Implements the business logic and handles the access to the DataAccessObjects.
    * DataAccessObjects: Interface for the database. Inserts, updates, deletes and reads objects from the database.
    * DomainObjects: Functional Objects which might be persisted in the database.

* We do provide code formatter for IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse in the etc folder

_NOTE: Please DO NOT publish the project, e.g. by uploading it to GitHub or the like!_

## Interview Process

During our Live Coding Interview you will be meeting with some of our Backend Developers. We will be presenting you with a task based on this project. You will share your 
screen content and think aloud to walk us through the solution you will develop.

* The challenge will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes
* You can ask any kind of question to us, both relating to the task or to use us as your "Search-Engine"
* You can use any other resource you like including the internet
* We want to simulate a "pair programming" atmosphere, so we will try to support you as much as we can without giving the full solution

You should be aware of the following conventions during the Coding Challenge and Interview

* You can use both Java or Kotlin
* Before the meeting make sure you can share your IDE via Zoom
* Please "think aloud" while you work. Explain your approach, what you are doing and why while we go along.
